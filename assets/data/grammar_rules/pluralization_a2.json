  "explanation": "Dutch plural formation follows several patterns. The most common is adding -EN, but there are many exceptions and special cases.\n\nMain patterns:\n• Most words: add -EN (de man → de mannen)\n• Some words: add -S (de auto → de auto's)\n• Special cases: kind → kinderen, stad → steden\n• Foreign words: usually add -S (de computer → de computers)\n\nImportant rules:\n• All plurals use DE as the article\n• Words ending in -heid become -heden\n• Words ending in vowels get -'s\n• Diminutives always add -s",
